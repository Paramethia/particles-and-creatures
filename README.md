# Particles & creatures

I started learning about particlesJS recently and I was interested in learning how to code on a canvas with JS. So this is my first project of drawing on a canvas and I am honestly kinda proud. I coded up some particles and made them interact with the creatures and bounce off segments of it. I thought I should add some options users can play around with. More options will be coming soon/later. Incase I am not too busy with other stuff, it may take a long time.

Made purely with JS and some HTML and CSS. 

**Warning**

It's not gonna work right on mobile yet. No creatures will be spawned nor will there be much styling for mobile. There will be particles that will appear tho and you can still update the settings.

Enjoy
