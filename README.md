# Particles & creatures

I started learning about particlesJS recently and I was interested in learning how to code on a canvas with JS. So this my first project of drawing on a canvas and I honestly kinda proud. I coded up some particles and made them interact with the creatureS and bounce off segments of it. I thought I should add some options to play around with. More options will be coming soon. Incase I am not too busy with other stuff, it may take a long time.
Made purely with JS and some HTML and CSS. 

Enjoy :)
